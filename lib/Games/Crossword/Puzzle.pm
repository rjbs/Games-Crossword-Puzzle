# ABSTRACT: six letters for "reusable unit of code"

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $puzzle = Games::Crossword::Puzzle->from_file('nyt-sunday.puz');

  for my $row ($puzzle->rows) {
    for my $cell (@$row) {
      die "Nope, not completed properly"
        if $cell->value and (not $cell->guess) || $cell->guess ne $cell->value;
    }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<.PUZ> file format is used by many crossword programs and, more
importantly, is offered by many newspapers.  It servers as both a puzzle and a
"saved game," storing the grid, the answers, the clues, and guesses.

Games::Crossword::Puzzle reads F<.PUZ> files and produces
Games::Crossword::Puzzle objects.

A puzzle is a rectangular grid of L<Games::Crossword::Puzzle::Cell> objects.

use Games::Crossword::Puzzle::Cell;

=method from_file

  my $puzzle = Games::Crossword::Puzzle->from_file($filename);

This method reads in a puzzle file and returns a puzzle object.  It will raise
an exception if the file does not appear to be a valid puzzle file.

  my ($class, $filename) = @_;

=method height

=method width

These methods return the height and width of the puzzle grid.

=cut

sub height { $_[0]->{height} }
sub width  { $_[0]->{width} }

=method rows

This method returns a list of arrayrefs, each representing one row of the grid.
Each arrayref is populated with Games::Crossword::Puzzle::Cell objects.

=cut

sub rows {
  my ($self) = @_;

  return @{ $self->{grid} };
}

=method cell

  my $cell = $puzzle->cell($number);

This method returns the cell with the given number.  Not every cell is
numbered!  Only cells that have clues are numbered.

This method will raise an exception if an invalid cell is requested.

=cut

sub cell {
  my ($self, $number) = @_;

  Carp::croak "invalid cell ($number) requested"
    unless exists $self->{number}{$number};

  return $self->{number}{$number};
}

=method title

This method returns the puzzle's title.

=method author

This method returns the puzzle's author.

=method copyright

This method returns the puzzle's copyright information.

=method note

This method returns the puzzle's "note," if any.

=cut

sub title     { $_[0]->{title} }
sub author    { $_[0]->{author} }
sub copyright { $_[0]->{copyright} }
sub note      { $_[0]->{note} }

=head1 CAVEATS

While there is some basic checking that the input file really is a puzzle file,
the checksums aren't checked, which could lead to loading an invalid file.  I
may get around to fixing this in the future.

=head1 THANKS

Josh Myer is a nerd and reverse engineered the PUZ format enough for this
module to be written.  I used his notes, found here:
L<http://www.joshisanerd.com/puz/>

=head1 SECRET ORIGINS

Daniel Jalkut, an internet-famous blogger, hyped up a forthcoming product for a
while, finally revealing that it was Black Ink, a nice crossword program for OS
X.  I like crosswords, but I didn't want to spend $25 on it, so I had a look
into the weird "PUZ" format it used.  I wrote this module as phase one in
producing my own free crossword software, possibly a PUZ-to-DHTML sort of
thing.  (Warning: I have been known to quit after phase one.)

(My loving wife later bought me a copy of Black Ink, so I didn't have much
reason to keep working on this, but I did finally add some basic rebus cell
parsing six years later.)
